\subsection{2.\+3 Product Functions}\label{index_subsection_name_2_3}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The objective of the Stingray Wi\+Fi robot, was to act as a temperature monitor. This was accomplished with three main functions, which work hand in hand to deliver the objective.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Reading the temperature from the thermal array sensor
\item Indicating the average temperature on the L\+ED by change of color
\item Displaying the ambient + 8 pixel temperatures on the L\+CD 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
Firstly, the temperature is read from the thermal array sensor. This is accomplished by using the I2C Software Protocol to establish a communication between the microcontroller and the thermal array sensor. The microcontroller (acting as the master device), goes on to read the ambient temperature of the thermal sensor, as well as the surrounding 8 pixel temperatures; after which they are then made available to the other modules. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
Given the average temperature collected from the thermal sensors; the Hydrogen Wi\+Fi shield L\+ED is used the indicate its range. The color of the L\+ED is either blue, green or red, indicating the average temperature is below 30oC, between 30 and 40oC or 40oC or greater respectively. The microcontroller is used to turn on the L\+ED using I/O voltage on pins, by sending a 0V. The intensity of the L\+ED is also controlled using the I/O voltage pin, through pulse width modulation. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The L\+CD display is used to display the ambient temperature of the thermal sensor, as well as the 8 pixel temperatures. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}

\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\section{Software Design}\label{index_section_name_4}
\subsection{4.\+1 Background Information}\label{index_subsection_name_4_1}
 \begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
To enable reading from and writing to the thermal array sensor, the I2\+C\+Multi\+Master software module was used. This module allows I2C communication via the hardware module provided in the Atmega2560 controller; thereby enabling us to configure the Atmega controller as the master device and the thermal array sensor as the slave device.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
To print information to the L\+CD, the C\+E\+G4166\+\_\+\+R\+T\+S\+\_\+\+L\+IB U\+S\+A\+RT module was used, this module allowed us to open the usart port for output to the L\+CD; and thereby enabling us to print characters on the L\+CD screen. \subsection{4.\+2 Thermal Sensor Software Module}\label{index_subsection_name_4_2}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
This module is responsible for reading information from the thermal array sensor. Communication between the atmega controller and the thermal sensor is done by using the functions provided by the I2\+C\+Multi\+Master module. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
Firstly, the start sequence is sent with the master address, using the I2\+C\+\_\+\+Master\+\_\+\+Initialise function. Then the address of the thermal sensor (the slave device), along with the address of the internal address to read from, are then sent using the I2\+C\+\_\+\+Master\+\_\+\+Start\+\_\+\+Transceiver\+\_\+\+With\+\_\+\+Data function. Afterwards, the read command is sent to the slave device with the I2\+C\+\_\+\+Master\+\_\+\+Start\+\_\+\+Transceiver\+\_\+\+With\+\_\+\+Data funciton, and then the I2\+C\+\_\+\+Master\+\_\+\+Get\+\_\+\+Data\+\_\+\+From\+\_\+\+Transceiver function is used to gather the data gotten the thermal sensor. 
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\subsection{4.\+3 Serial\+L\+C\+D\+Module Software Module}\label{index_subsection_name_4_3}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
This module is used to print characters to the screen. Therefore, this module is responsible for printing the ambient temperature, as well as the 8 pixel temperatures read from thermal array sensor.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
The screen is first cleared, and then using the usart\+Write function, the cursor is positioned on the first spot on the L\+CD, in order to print the message \+A\+M\+BT\+:. Following this, the ambient temperature along with the 8 pixel temperatures are printed on the screen, moving the cursor each time to allow spacing between the temperature readings. After printing each set of the temperature values, a delay of 1000/port\+T\+I\+C\+K\+\_\+period\+\_\+\+MS is used. This is done in order to keep temperature reading on the screen long enough to read. \subsection{4.\+4 L\+E\+D Software Module}\label{index_subsection_name_4_4}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
This module is used to change the color of the L\+ED, depending on the average temperature from the thermal sensor. Firstly, the pins assigned to the three L\+ED colors (blue, green, red) are set to output at 5V. Afterwards, the L\+ED colors are set according to the average value using the avr/io modules.
